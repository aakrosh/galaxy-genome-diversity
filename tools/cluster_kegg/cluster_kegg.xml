**What it does**

The program builds a network of gene categories connected by shared
genes.  The edges of this network are weighted based on the number of
genes that each node shares.  The clustering coefficient, c\ :sub:`u`\ , is then calculated for each node using the formula:

|

where deg(u) is the degree of u and edge weights, w\ :sub:`uv`\ ,
are normalized by the maximum weight in the network.  The cluster
coefficients are then filtered by our program based on threshold (that
could be a percentile or a value choose by the user) and all the nodes
with a cluster coefficient lower than this threshold are deleted from
the network.  Finally, the program reports each connected component as
a cluster of gene classifications.  With our program a lower number of
gene categories is obtained, but the results are easier to interpret as
they exclude genes present in many gene groups.
