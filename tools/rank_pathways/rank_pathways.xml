**Dataset formats**

The query dataset has a column containing ENSEMBL transcript codes for
the gene set of interest, while the background dataset has one column
with ENSEMBL transcript codes and another with KEGG pathways, for some larger
universe of genes.

All of the input and output datasets are in tabular_ format.  The input
dataset (i.e. query) to rank by "percentage of genes affected" has a
column containing ENSEMBL transcript codes for the gene set of interest,
while the background dataset has one column with ENSEMBL transcript
codes and another with KEGG pathways, for some larger universe of genes.
The input dataset to rank by "change in length and number of paths"
must have columns with KEGG gene ID and pathways.  The output datasets
are described below.  (`Dataset missing?`_)

**What it does**

Given a query set of genes from a larger background dataset, this tool
evaluates the over- or under-representation of KEGG pathways in the query
set, using the specified statistical test.  Alternatively, the tool ranks
the pathways based on the change in length and number of paths connecting
sources and sinks.  This change is calculated between graphs representing
pathways with and without excluding the nodes that represent the genes
in an input list.  Sources are all the nodes representing the initial
reactants/products in the pathway.  Sinks are all the nodes representing
the final reactants/products in the pathway.

If pathways are ranked by percentage of genes affected, the output
contains a row for each KEGG pathway, with the following columns:

1. count: the number of genes in the query set that are in this pathway
2. representation: the percentage of this pathway's genes (from the background dataset) that appear in the query set
3. ranking of this pathway, based on its representation ("1" is highest)
4. probability of depletion of this pathway in the query dataset
5. probability of enrichment of this pathway in the query dataset
6. name of the pathway

If pathways are ranked by change in length and number of paths, the
output is a tabular dataset with the following columns:

1. change in the mean length of paths between sources and sinks
2. mean length of paths between sources and sinks in the pathway including the genes in the input dataset. If the pathway do not have sources/sinks, the length is assumed to be infinite (I)
3. mean length of paths between sources and sinks in the pathway excluding the genes in the input dataset. If the pathway do not have sources/sinks, the length is assumed to be infinite (I)
4. rank of the change in the mean length of paths between sources and sinks (from high change to low change)
5. change in the number of paths between sources and sinks
6. number of paths between sources and sinks in the pathway including the genes in the input dataset. If the pathway do not have sources/sinks, it is assumed to be a circuit (C)
7. number of paths between sources and sinks in the pathway excluding the genes in the input dataset. If the pathway do not have sources/sinks, it is assumed to be a circuit (C)
8. rank of the change in the number of paths between sources and sinks (from high change to low change)
9. name of the pathway
